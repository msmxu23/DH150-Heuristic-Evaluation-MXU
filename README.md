## Music Streaming Platforms
## Project Description
I selected two music streaming platforms to evaluate. Both music apps came out last year. One app--Audius is too minimal and simple, which may cause users to feel bored or unaware of certain elements. The second app, Audiomack is too clumpy and all over the place. By analyzing these two apps on the opposite sides of a spectrum, I will be able to learn what needs to be fixed, taken away, added, or changed, what is considered too much or too little information. My goal is to design an app that becomes an essential for music listeners/lovers by incorporating the necessary balance from each heuristic and with this heuristic evaluation, I can think of how to make a music app more flexible and efficient to use, gives users the information needed to finish their tasks effectively, and for them to have a great experience doing so.

#### Brief Information 
Audius is a streaming platform that is aimed towards all musicians and not just those who are signed to major labels or deals. Soundcloud, another streaming platform that followed a similar route, had a lot of issues regarding copyright but Audius has found out a way to work around the restrictions and let artists upload their music freely. Audius is also “the only music streaming platform built on a new technology paradigm - Ethereum - which has unprecedented built-in financial tools,” meaning artists will get paid more than they would if they were a part of a label or a different streaming platform.  Open to the public since 2019, the platform has gained traction in getting various artists to join their project and continues to expand.

#### Motivation/Evaluation 
As a San Francisco native, it was really cool for a SF startup company to find an innovative way to support artists while being sustainable. But, Audius falls under the “too minimalistic/innovative” vibe as the platform itself mirrors the work of a techie from Silicon Valley and not really from a creative perspective. I believe a proper heuristic evaluation will pinpoint issues and discover ways to improve the app.

#### Brief Information 
Audiomack was founded in 2012 by Dave Macli and David Ponte; the two wanted artists to freely share their music without little to no barriers. In comparison to streaming giants like Spotify and Apple Music, the six-year-old company separates itself by being completely free to artists and listeners; their money comes from advertisements and premium subscriptions. Although the platform revolves around hip-hop/rap, the streaming service has a wide variety of genres that users can browse. 

#### Motivation/Evaluation 
I was shocked to discover a streaming platform that has such a huge listener base despite not having any of my friends, family, or colleagues use Audiomack. As a supporter of various music platforms that best fit different preferences, I decided to do an evaluation on a company’s newly made mobile app. After briefly looking through their app, I concluded that the streaming platform’s app is overwhelming and outdated.
