# Project Description
I selected two music streaming platforms to evaluate. Both music apps came out last year. One app--Audius is too minimal and simple, which may cause users to feel bored or unaware of certain elements. The second app, Audiomack is too clumpy and all over the place. By analyzing these two apps on the opposite sides of a spectrum, I will be able to learn what needs to be fixed, taken away, added, or changed, what is considered too much or too little information. My goal is to design an app that becomes an essential for music listeners/lovers by incorporating the necessary balance from each heuristic and with this heuristic evaluation, I can think of how to make a music app more flexible and efficient to use, gives users the information needed to finish their tasks effectively, and for them to have a great experience doing so.
